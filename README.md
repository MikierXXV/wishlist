# Wishlist with React 

## Description

This is a wishlist app built with React. It allows users to add items to a wishlist, and mark them as purchased. It also allows users to delete items from the wishlist.

The main goal of this project was to learn how to use React. I learned how to use components, props, state, and how to pass data between components.
